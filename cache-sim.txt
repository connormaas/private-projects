Background: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)

This program simulates a cache by first parsing the command line for specific arguments, including s (the amount of bits for the set index), b (the amount 
of bits for the block offset), E (the number of lines per set), h (help), and v (an optional debugging tool). It then parses a trace file, which contains 
load and save data with specific addresses (to read and write), as well as ask the number of bytes. The program prints the amount of Hits, Misses, 
Evictions, Dirty Bytes, and Dirty Byte Evictions.
