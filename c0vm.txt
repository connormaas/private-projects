Inspired by JVM (background): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine

c0vm is a virtual machine for C0 (C-like language developed at CMU). It is a stack-based machine which handles arithmetic operations and other 
instructions. The call stack consists of frames, each one containing local variables, a local operand stack, and a return address. Operands are popped from 
an operand stack and their result is pushed back onto the stack. Functions defined in a source file are kept in a “function pool” and library functions are 
kept in a “native pool”.
